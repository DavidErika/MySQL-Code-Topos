## üìÅ SQL Code Repository
This repository serves as a centralized collection of my SQL scripts, queries, and database-related work. It includes a variety of code examples ranging from basic 
SQL operations to more complex data manipulation, analysis, and optimization techniques. The purpose of this repo is to showcase my skills in working with relational 
databases and provide reusable SQL code for reference and learning.
